# ProcessWire Page Hit Counter
![alt text](https://github.com/FlipZoomMedia/RepoAssets/blob/master/PageHitCounter/pagehitcounter-example.png)
## Simple Page View Tracking

The Page Hit Counter module for ProcessWire implements a simple page view counter in backend. Page views of visitors are automatically tracked on defined templates, with monitoring of multiple page views.

This gives you a quick overview of how many visitors have read a news or a blog post, for example, without first having to open complex tools such as Google Analytics. This module quickly provides simple information, e.g. for editors. Or, for example, to sort certain news by most page views. For example for "Trending Topics".

Works with `ProCache` and `AdBlockers`. With a lightweight tracking code of only ~320 bytes (gzipped). And no code changes necessary! In addition GDPR compliant, since no personal data or IP addresses are stored. Only session cookies are stored without information.

In addition, there are some options, for example filtering IP addresses (for CronJobs) and filtering bots, spiders and crawlers. You can also configure the lifetime of the session cookies. Repeated page views are not counted during this period. It is also possible to exclude certain roles from tracking. For example, logged in editors who work on a page are not counted as page views.

## Sort by hits and access page views (hit value)
Each trackable template has an additional field called `phits`. For example, you want to output all news sorted by the number of page views.
```php
// It is assumed that the template, e.g. with the name "news", has been configured for tracking.
$news = $pages->find("template=news, sort=-phits");
```
To output the page views of a tracked page, use:
```php
echo $page->phits;
```
## Example: Tracking a page hit via API and jQuery
If you want to track a template that does not represent a full page to automatically inject a tracking script, you can define allowed API templates in the module that you can track.

Below is an example of how you can track a click on news tag using jQuery. This will allow you to find out which keywords are clicked the most. For example, you can sort and display a tag cloud by the number of hits.

Suppose your keywords have the template "news_tag". The template "news_tag" was also configured in the Page Hit Counter Module as a trackable API template.

**PHP output of keywords / tags**
```php
// Required: the data attribute "data-pid" with the ID of the template to be tracked.
echo $pages->find("template=news_tag, sort=-phits")->each("<a href='{url}' class='news_tag' data-pid='{id}'>{title}</a>");
```
**Example Tracking Script with jQuery**
```javascript
/**
 * Required: Data attribute "data-pid" with the ID of the news tag template
 * Required: Send the POST request to the URL "location.pathname.replace(/\/?$/, '/') + 'phcv1'"
 * Required: The POST parameter "pid" with the ID of the template
 */
$(function(){
    if($('a.news_tag').length > 0) {
        $('a.news_tag').each(function(){
            var tPID = $(this).data("pid");
            if(tPID) {
                $(this).on("click", function(){
                    $.post(location.pathname.replace(/\/?$/, '/') + 'phcv1', {pid: tPID});
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
```
So simply every click on a tag is counted. Including all checks as for automatic tracking. Like Bot Filtering, Session Lifetime, etc.

### Pros
- Automatic Page View Tracking
- Lightweight tracking code, only ~320 bytes (gzipped)
- No code or frontend changes necessary
- Works with ProCache! Even if no PHP is executed on the cached page, the tracking works
- Works with browser AdBlockers
- No cache triggers (for example, ProCache) are triggered. The cache remains persistent
- GDPR compliant, session-based cookie only, no personal information
- Filtering of IPs and bots possible
- Exclude certain roles from tracking
- Ability to reset Page Views
- Works with all admin themes
- Counter database is created as write-optimized InnoDB
- API to track events for templates that are not viewable
- No dependencies on libraries, pure VanillaJS (Automatic tracking script)
- Works in all modern browsers
- Pages are sortable by hits

### Cons
- Only for ProcessWire version 3.0.80 or higher (Requires wireCount())
- Only for PHP version 5.6.x or higher
- No support for Internet Explorer <= version 9 (Because of XMLHttpRequest())
- No historical data, just simple summation (Because of GDPR)

#### Notes
*By default, the page views are stored as `INT` in the database. This allows a maximum counter value of 4.2 billion views (4,294,967,295) per page. If you need more, change the type to `BIGINT` directly in the database. But I recommend to use Google Analytics or similar tools if you have such a large number of users.*
